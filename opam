description:
  """HTTP client library and unix utility relying solely on the OCaml
     standard library. If the `tls` package is installed, support
     for HTTPS will additionally be compiled in.
     The library uses asynchronous I/O, and the HTTP stack is
     independent of the effectful layer, an implementation is
     provided for Unix."""
